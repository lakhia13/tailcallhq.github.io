# Building Scalable APIs with GraphQL



## Why is Scalability Important?



Increasing traffic is a common issue any application faces as it grows in popularity. It is also a test because it decides if the business is sustainable.

Building scalable APIs with GraphQL is essential because it enables efficient data loading, supports real-time data, and provides a single endpoint for all queries, improving performance, flexibility, and developer experience. This scalability ensures high traffic and large-data-set handling, ensuring seamless user experiences.



## Scalability Hiccups (And how to solve them)



### N+1 Problem

To put it simply, this occurs when the server attempts to fetch data inefficiently. Here the server makes multiple requests to get data that can be fetched in one request. This problem only grows with an increase in the nested data. It leads to unnecessary requests, which ultimately bog down the server and wastes resources.

The Solution:

```graphql
code goes here
```

### 

### Lack of Automatic Caching

Unlike REST APIs, GraphQL doesn't have built-in caching mechanisms, which can increase server load for frequently requested data.

The Solution:

You can use persisted queries to cache common queries on the server.

```graphql
code goes here
```

### 

### Over-fetching at the Database Level

While GraphQL prevents over-fetching on the client side, it may lead to over-fetching at the database level if not implemented carefully.

The Solution:

```graphql
code goes here
```

### 

### Complexity of Queries

GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need, which can lead to complex queries that are resource-intensive to process on the server.

The Solution:

You can implement a query complexity calculation system. After assessing the complexity of the query you can set limits on query complexity to prevent overly resource-intensive requests

```graphql
code goes here
```

## Conclusion

To conclude, GraphQL is a powerful tool that under the correct circumstances can be used to replace REST APIs; but it has its own set of issues. In terms of scalability, these issues need to be addressed to make any project sustainable for the long term.

I hope this blog gives you a little idea of how you can build a scalable GraphQL API.
